Firstable, I plan to analyze EEG signals of people exposed to the relaxation method I chose based on literature overview (Rodriguez et al., 2020). Since I have to make sure that a given type of relaxation produces the desired effect I want to achieve. Subsequently, I would have obtained a 360-degree video to be able to simulate a visit to the museum as realistically as possible thanks to the collaboration with the Museum of the Origins of the Polish State in Gniezno,. Using Virtual Reality and Eye-Tracking recordings, I would analyze the degree of immersion of the subject with art depending on the groups.

If so, museums are places where we would like to enhance our cognition however there are still only a few studies searching universal patterns that would influence every recipient of the exhibition. According to the model of aesthetic experience (Leder et al., 2004), cognitive processing of cultural content produces affective and often positive impressions. Latest research showed that stronger affect (i.e. anger) correlates with increased susceptibility to suggestions about false details connected to the presented material (Greenstein & Franklin, 2020). Therefore we can assume that stronger emotions have a visible impact on the audience whereas regulation of affect may influence successive cognition.",

Investigation approach-avoidance behaviours using ambiguous stimuli i.e. both either positive or both negative, that differ in arousal (Fricke, Vogel, 2020).

      background:"Music has been revealed to stimulate the brain by influencing neuronal oscillations (Jancke, Leipold, Burkhard, 2018). The pattern of neuronal activity can be seen as fingerprints of cognitive processes (Siegel, Donner & Engel, 2012). One way to assess the state of concentration or relaxation is to analyze the EEG signal, specifically the amplitude of the alpha and beta bands (George, Lotte, Abad, Lécuyer, 2011). In recent years, the use of functional music has become increasingly popular - that is, music that in a specific, intentional way influences the user's cognitive abilities (Jones, Schumacher, 1992). Functional music is designed to have effects on neurophysiology by means of acoustic modulation (salience reduction, 3D spatialization, modulation to alter brain activity, etc.). This innovative form of music is generated and tested by the Brain.fm team, which opens the door to further research in this aspect (www.brain.fm, 2021).",

During training their neuronal activity will be measured by using 8-channels EEG system [Perun-8 (BrainTech)]. Eye movement also will be recorded to track fixation points and gaze duration – glasses with eye-tracker will be used to do this. Before starting the training participants will fill out the STAI test (). The test will be retaken after a period of six weeks, i.e. upon completing the archery training. The size of a target will vary depending on the participant's level of focus. The more focused the participant is, the larger the target he/she will shoot at becomes. To control this variable I will use a program, which will link the appearance of the appropriate low beta frequency (13–16 Hz) (Tarrant et al., 2018; Huang & Lo, 2009) with the size of the target.",

      background:"This study introduces promising anxiety, and possibly depression or ADHD, therapy methods (Tarrant, 2017). Such training can be more beneficial than most neurofeedback sessions since it is combined with physical exercises. It will also enable a better mindfulness practice than normal archery, as it will force the subject to control his/hers focus and not yield to excitement when the target grows larger. Moreover, the program created for this study may be useful also during different experiments as it allows researchers to connect the participant’s neural activity with stimuli they receive.",

Computing these networks on GPU (compute shader and GLSL) creates a way to train models faster than other libraries on single GPU units like Geforce GTX1080 or RTX2080. Further areas of research involve generating predictions over a big set of data (big data) and finding patterns for creating triggers to control IOT (Internet Of Things) with EEG brainwaves. This method involves using raw data with a notch filter as input for the prediction model, data can be stored as 2D textures(QEEG) in 3D arrays for future analyses. Training neural networks using textures as input data gives us the way to perceive different aspects of signal over brain activity. From generating different methods of interpolation to unification for EEG big data datasets for a non-changing architecture of neural network model.",

      background:"The technology of brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a new way of interacting with devices, by allowing people to control a computer system through their brain signals without the need for physical activity. BCI has huge potential as an assistive technology, for enabling  and rehabilitative purposes. Unmanned aerial devices (UAV) or drones have been gaining popularity in our daily lives, such as in photography. Research has also been done in designing BCI for drone piloting. Such BCIs provide users with a hands-free method to control the drone. This field has a potential in allowing the disabled to reach and interact with objects via the drone [4]. It can be also considered as a tool in neurofeedback therapies. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the principle methods of acquiring brain signals non-invasively in BCI control applications. Most research in BCI drone control uses research-grade EEG headsets with 14 to 64 wet electrodes. While such devices provide the benefit of high accuracy, they have limited usability due to tedious set-up and cleanup procedures, high costs and restricted movement. On the other hand, consumer-grade EEG devices are cheaper and have better usability, but are more vulnerable to noise and have limited sensors at fixed locations. Nonetheless, consumer-grade EEG systems have been shown to be able to demonstrate various neural phenomena.",
